Next in my series of great podcasts is Information Security. I spend a lot of time in my current job fixing broken computers and part of that involves disinfecting and restoring operating systems back to their fully functional selves.

# Security and Technology Podcasts

* [Security now](https://www.grc.com/securitynow.htm)
  
  Amazing podcast on the world of information security. This podcast not only talks about the major news items that every IT person should know about but also explains very complex concepts in an easy to understand manor. Leo Laporte and Steve Gibson masterfully come together as an unstoppable force to create a wave of understanding for the complex world of info security. Worth a listen if you're even remotely interested in what is going on in the technology world as well as the hacker underground.
