        <title>Great Podcasts - Programming</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As I spend time working on my projects I often need something to fill the backround noise. One of the ways I do this is by listening to podcasts. I feel that podcasts while entertaining also provide some educational value and allow me to not get too buried by my focus while learning something new. Not only do these podcasts enlighten me to new ideas and topics but also really help to supplement the long commute that I have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To kick off my series of posts I will post the programming podcasts that I listen to while I drive and while I work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;programming&quot;&gt;Programming&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developertea.com&quot;&gt;Developer Tea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Great podcast for anyone interested in being a productive programmer. They offer tips and techniques for getting things done and being productive in your day as a programmer. The episodes are relatively short (20-30 minutes), and typically there are 1 to 2 episodes per week. Jonathan often interviews industry experts and gets their insight and opinions on a multitude of issues.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;www.codenewbie.org&quot;&gt;Code Newbie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Yet another great podcast for new programmers. Like developer tea, Saran interviews many industry professionals about their skills and techniques. This podcast goes on a bit more about the culture of the tech industry, it hits on a multitude of issues from equality in the workplace and in the coding community. Episodes are typically 20-30 minutes but sometimes are longer when it’s necessary. New episodes tend to come out on a weekly basis.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dotnetrocks.com/&quot;&gt;.Net Rocks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A great podcast for more than just .net. While a lot of the focus is on Windows application development it spans a broad set of frameworks and coding methodologies as well as hitting on the latest news in the programming and Windows world. Episodes tend to be longer, around an hour long and typically come out on a weekly basis.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.programmingthrowdown.com/&quot;&gt;Programming Throwdown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This podcast spans a wide variety of different languages and technologies in the field. Anything from python to tamper protection are covered in this podcast and often times the hosts go into great detail on the things they plan on talking about. Episodes are typically an hour long but sometimes can be shorter or longer depending on the topic being covered and they generally come out on a monthly basis.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://5by5.tv/changelog&quot;&gt;The Changelog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Great podcast that goes over a variety of topics in the open source world. Adam and Jerod go over the newest topics and news and do an awesome job of highlighting what is popular in the open source coding scene. This podcast is also a great resource on information on amazing self hosted applications as well as great open source tools. Worth a listen if you’re interested in how everything works in land of open source software. Episodes are typically just over an hour long and come out on a bi-monthly basis.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Raspberry Pi Projects</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you live under a rock or just do not know what a Raspberry Pi is it is a small “Micro” computer that is relatively low cost that runs Linux operating systems such as Debian using an ARM processor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get asked a lot about what I use my Raspberry Pis for so I figured I would compile a list of the different projects and applications that I run on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I currently own 4 Pis. Two are Raspberry Pi 2s, One Raspberry Pi 1, and one Raspberry Pi 0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the Raspberry Pi 2s I use one as a dedicated VPN end point into my home network. The idea is that when I’m on the road I want to be able to tunnel my traffic through an encrypted connection back to my house then out to the Internet in an attempt to keep potential malicious actors from sniffing my traffic and doing what they will with it. I also have that Pi set up as a LAMP server for when I need to test a deployment of a website before I publish it onto the Internet. Along with the LAMP server and VPN I also have it set up as a client for the popular Lounge IRC client for when I need to get into an IRC room to ask questions or contribute to a conversation. Finally the last thing I use this Pi for is as a custom DNS server that blocks advertisements for all the devices on my home network using the Pi-Hole application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other Pi 2 is being used as a Retro Pi/Kodi System. Essentially it is a conglomeration of many popular video game system emulators for when I am seeking out some of that sweet nostalgic gaming from yesteryear. Kodi also adds a very flexible and powerful media center application. I use this for a mainly watching Movies/TV, youtube, twitch streams, and podcasts. It also acts as an RSS reader and keeps me informed on what the weather is in a few different locations. This Pi also runs an SMB server so that any device on the network can access any saved media files on it for their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Raspberry Pi 1 is being used as a hub for a couple cameras. I use this as a home security system that takes still images whenever it detects motion. It then sends me a digest in an email daily of what it captured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally I am still working on what I want to do with the Raspberry Pi 0. I have played with the idea of using it as an on the go DNS black-hole for blocking advertisements when I’m on the road. I’m sure I will come up with a practical use for it that capitalizes on its extremely small form factor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a compiled list of all the tools/applications used with the pis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Nyr/openvpn-install&quot;&gt;Open VPN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://elinux.org/RPi_A_Simple_Wheezy_LAMP_install&quot;&gt;PI LAMP Server Tutorial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/thelounge/lounge&quot;&gt;The Lounge IRC Client&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pi-hole.net/&quot;&gt;Pi-Hole Ad Blocker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/retropie/retropie-setup/wiki&quot;&gt;Retro Pi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mymediaexperience.com/raspberry-pi-xbmc-with-raspbmc/&quot;&gt;Kodi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneye/wiki/Install-On-Raspbian&quot;&gt;Motion Eye&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any further questions regarding my setup feel free to leave me a comment below!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Added School Projects to GitHub</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Added a lot of my school programming projects to my GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the repository here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DerfOh/School-Programming-Projects&quot;&gt;School-Programming-Projects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also worth mentioning that I uploaded the code for  &lt;a href=&quot;http://undeaddata.derfoh.me&quot;&gt;Undead Data&lt;/a&gt; to a repository as well. I had to figure out the GNU GPL for this one. I hope if there is any issue with how I implemented the license into the source someone will mention it to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intent behind licensing with the GPL was so that everyone who worked on the project could get equal credit for their contributions if any of us decide to use it for a portfolio or application that might result in a change in the intellectual property. My group members and I put a lot of work into getting everything together for the site to demonstrate our mastery of the knowledge gained from out database design course.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Fallout 4 Enable Mods Script</title>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is the application?
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The application is a small script that when run properly on a fresh install of Fallout 4 enables the user to start downloading and installing modified content into their game. I made this script because I was tired of having to do this over and over for myself as well as friends and family. This script provides a simple set of instructions to the user directing them to place it in the appropriate folder and then run it. It then makes the appropriate changes to the ini files of the game to allow modified content to be loaded properly.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What platform is it for?
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This script is only compatible with Windows operating systems.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What did you learn from making this?
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;While I understood these things it provided an oportunity for me to reivew how to copy, make, and edit files using a batch script.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Where do I get it?
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The script can be obtained from one of two sources:
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DerfOh/EnableFalloutModsScript&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/10496/&quot;&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Changes to 841g site</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Lately I have been working on getting a website I made for a gaming comunity moved over to github pages. A lot of the sites that I have thrown together really only have basic needs in terms of the capability of what is required on the back end. As for web servers however after years of doing things such as trying to navigate a cPanel with millions of different functions spread haphazardly, to manually implementing a LAMP stack (or rather a LAP stack as I didn’t have much use for SQL until recently). I have found that at this point it is worth learning the way GitHub hosts their pages if your primary goal is to just make a basic site for a club or a group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said we have changed much of the design at the site (you can check it out &lt;a href=&quot;http://841g.github.io&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our case me (and another community manager) created an organization to keep things simpler when it came to both of us working on the site. It had become troublesome to get his fork up to date every time a pull needed to be made between the forks. We are both hoping that commiting to the same repo will simplify things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure though if for just us two this is more of a “nuclear option” and that it might be a bit overkill for just a small team. I wonder what aproaches other people generally take for this. For now though this works for us and hopefully if there are eventually more coding projects added under the org it will allow us to scale better as we get more members. I plan to eventually move a few of the bots that we use in our various group chats the group uses under the organization too in hopes that other members decide to work on them.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Changing Default Git Shell</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Had some trouble finding an answer to this, maybe I was wording it wrong. Here it is in case there is another curious party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To change the shell that you use do the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click on the cog in the upper right of the GitHub gui&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Select &lt;code&gt;Options&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Directly under &lt;code&gt;Clone Path&lt;/code&gt; there is an option: &lt;code&gt;Default Shell&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Select the shell you want to use when you go to start&amp;gt;git shell&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click Save&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now when you select Git Shell from your start menu it will open Git Bash.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Undead Data</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For my SQL class this semester we were asked to do a series of things that walked us through the creation of a great relational database. For my project our group decided on making a database for a fictional post-apocalyptic world where zombies are roaming the earth. Think watered down version of an application that could be used to keep track of the characters on popular television shows or movies. Another possible use for the design as discussed by my group is in making some sort of table top turn based game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wile the sole purpose of the project was just to create the database, not a front end, I decided to take things one step further for our deliverable for the end of the semester. I made it into a full LAMP stack website that demonstrated that the database and their queries can work with current web design standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also this project allotted me a good excuse to learn a bit of PHP as I had minimal experience with it as a language prior to this experience. Ultimately while the code is clearly amateur it was a great way to learn a good variety of things such as but not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Basic PHP formatting and syntax&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Using PHP to connect to a SQL database&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Using PHP to query and draw the output into HTML tables.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;POST and GET operations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Full LAMP Stack design philosophy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway here is a link to the project. I will probably keep it up indefinitely or until I decide I want to use that particular VPS for something different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;undead-datahttpundeaddataderfohme&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://undeaddata.derfoh.me&quot;&gt;Undead Data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

        <title>VB Table Lookup</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In my time  as a tutor I found that students struggled a lot with the concept of stepping through a multidemensional array. The concept of a table lookup is not necessarily the hardest thing to figure out but at the same time it takes a bit of thinking on the part of the programmer to conceptualize the logic behind it.
So the table looks somewhat like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Our Part&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;Brand A&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;Brand B&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;Brand C&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Our Part  1&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;A1&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;B1&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;C1&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Our Part  2&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;A2&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;B2&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;C2&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Our Part  3&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;A3&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;B3&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;C3&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
  &lt;tfoot&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tfoot&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of this class the particular requirement of one of the applications the students make is that it has to go through an array of different parts made by different brands and it has to match that part up with the name of the part at the company. This lesson is a great way to introduce the capabilities of arrays as well as loops. I have also found that it is  a great way to introduce a student to Visual Studio’s debugger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the real meat is the code that steps through this array:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-vb&quot; data-lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;For&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;columninteger&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;As&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Integer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;To&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;numberOfColumns&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;&#39;steps through every row, this value can be changed to fit your needs.&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;For&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rowinteger&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;As&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Integer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;To&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;numberOfRows&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;&#39;steps through every column, this value can be changed to fit your needs.&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;If&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;partsnumberstring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;columninteger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rowinteger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;PartsTextBox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ToUpper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;Then&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;MessageBox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Show&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Found part: &quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;partsnumberstring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;columninteger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rowinteger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;   --   Our Part: &quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;partsnumberstring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;columninteger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;&#39;if the string matches put out the value in the first column&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;End&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;If&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;Next&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;Next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;what the code does is it steps through every column and row one by one cand compares the value in the text box that the user enters to the value found in that particular portion of the array. If the value matches the code outputs a message to the user that shows the part number they entered and the part number of the company’s part that matches it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>GadgetSearch</title>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is the application?
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;GadgetSearch is an application I made to teach my self as much android programming as I could. The primary reasoning behind this was that there are no applications that I could find that could search across on line retailers quickly for the latest and best technology.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What platform is it for?
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Currently Gadget Search is only for Android devices. There is no version of iOS devices planned for future releases.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What did you learn from making this?
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I learned many of the basics of programming in Android. I primarily used the Eclipse editor in conjunction with the Android SDK to build and test the project. I have since ported my development work flow over to Android Studio.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The concepts of android that I got from this experience include:
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Android Debugging&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Basic Android Syntax and libraries&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Design properties and layouts for front end UI&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Calling another app and passing information between applications (in this case a key word)&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;How to use intents to start activities in other applications (in this case the bar code scanner)&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Many other concepts associated with android development&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Where do I get it?
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Gadget Search can be downloaded from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.derfohappco.gadgetsearch&quot;&gt;Google Play Store&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Working with blog theme</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I had a heck of a time figuring out how to theme jekyll. You’d think there would be just one css file to edit but you would be very wrong. Apparently themes for Jekyll are an issue and are not very consistent in their implementation. Furthermore the things you might be seeing as local changes when building the site locally do not show up on github’s build of the site. I wasn’t aware that build errors get sent to your email so it was good that I learned that. Something as simple as changing the font color in the highlighted fields has proven to be very difficult however. It even took me a bit to figure out how to get the title of the blog to a different color. I persevered though in at least changing the color of the site’s title.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that the file I need to edit in my directory is in the &lt;code&gt;_sass&lt;/code&gt; folder, the themes then seem to be laid out in a similar fashion to a regular css file but it looks like there are variables that can be set in the &lt;code&gt;css\main.scss&lt;/code&gt; file. This has been my first encounter with Sass files and find it intreguiing that you can use CSS in this way. There are a few more tweaks I’d like to do You can find more about this language at &lt;a href=&quot;http://sass-lang.com/&quot;&gt;http://sass-lang.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also found a great resource for the type of markdown my Jekyll implementation is using (called kramdown) at &lt;a href=&quot;http://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html&quot;&gt;http://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I have the site looking mostly how I want it to I am going to be working towards making more posts about the projects that I have currently on GitHub and go over their purpose, and if I expect to expand upon them.&lt;/p&gt;
