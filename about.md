# Bio

Much of my expertise derives from my love for all things electronic. I have a deep passion in my heart for learning new things involving computers and I actively seek out new and interesting things that technology enables me to do. I am currently working towards a Bachelor of Computer Information Systems degree at the University of Michigan. I have had an active education in the various forms of programming languages including [(but not limited to)](../codestats/) COBOL, C++, Python, Java, Android, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. As well as the usage of a wide range of computer systems and applications. I also spend a huge amount of my free time working on a variety of open source projects on GitHub.

I currently am employed as an Advance Repair Agent for Geek Squad. In this roll I am primarily tasked with troubleshooting and repairing end-user devices that are checked in for more technical repairs and services that cannot be performed within 24 hours. On a daily basis I remove malicious applications, troubleshoot and repair faulty software and malfunctioning hardware, and perform data backup and recovery services. I am also asked to support users in software installation and setup as well as educate end users of proper care and use for their gadgets. Secondary duties include shipping and receiving parts and client devices, book keeping for internal business, legal, and technical paperwork. This roll has given me the opportunity to master working on a small team to maintain internal operations of an IT help desk and provide exceptional customer service in a highly technical and complex, time sensitive, environment.

I have also worked as a teacher's aide for a class that taught VB.net and Visual Studio at the University of Michigan CSEP Department. I assisted the course instructor with grading homework projects and helping students grasp difficult concepts in class involving their code. Not only did this give me experience with working with other people's code it also gave me an opportunity to mentor and teach my peers in a cooperative and cohesive manor. Working as an aid taught me a great deal about debugging as well, there were times where stepping through a method with a student was the best way of helping a student figure out how they can get their code working.

I have sales experience working as a consultant for Best Buy. I have crafted custom office solutions for customers involving software and hardware combinations of software and computing equipment such as laptop and desktop computers, printers, networking equipment, display technology, as well as a multitude of other input/output devices. Along with these things I was tasked with performing demonstrations and helping the end users with using their newly possessed gadgetry.
