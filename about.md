Much of my experience is derived from my daily tinkering with computers and code, my enthusiasm enables me to pick up on complex ideas at a very fast pace. I am currently enrolled in the Bachelor's program in Computer Information Systems at the University of Michigan. I have had an active education in the various forms of programming languages including (but not limited to) COBOL, C++, Python, Java, HTML, and CSS. As well as the usage of a wide range of computer systems and applications.

I currently work as an Advance Repair Agent at Best Buy. In this roll I am primarily tasked with troubleshooting and repairing end-user devices. On a daily basis I remove malicious applications, troubleshoot faulty software, diagnose hardware issues, and perform data services. I am also asked to support users in software installation and setup as well as educate end users of proper care and use for their gadgets. Secondary duties include shipping and receiving parts and client devices, book keeping for internal business, legal, and technical paperwork. 

I worked as a sales consultant for Best Buy. I craft custom office solutions for customers involving software and hardware combinations of computing equipment such as laptop and desktop computers, printers, networking equipment, display technology, as well as a multitude of other input/output devices. 

I have worked as a meat clerk and sanitation technician for more than four years at different grocery stores. Along with this unique experience I also had to work with a team of meat cutters and clerks to provide adequate customer service with things such as specialized cuts and custom product orders. I also worked as a closing meat clerk at the Kroger grocery chain, this has provided me with experience with working long hours independently to complete my duties while providing friendly customer service in a corporate environment.
