I found an easy way to implement an archive page into my Jekyll blog. Thanks to the author over at [reyhan.org](http://reyhan.org) I now have a simple archive page for the posts that I make to this log.

I had to add a file to my `_layouts` directory called `archive.html` that had the code from [this site](http://reyhan.org/2013/03/jekyll-archive-without-plugins.html).

Then I added the archive.md so that the link would show up in the header. Next up I will be setting up analytics, and making it so that the front page is only limited to 5 posts.
