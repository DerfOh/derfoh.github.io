* What is the application?
	* GadgetSearch is an application I made to teach my self as much android programming as I could. The primary reasoning behind this was that there are no applications that I could find that could search across on line retailers quickly for the latest and best technology.

* What platform is it for?
	* Currently Gadget Search is only for Android devices. There is no version of iOS devices planned for future releases.

* What did you learn from making this?
	* I learned many of the basics of programming in Android. I primarily used the Eclipse editor in conjunction with the Android SDK to build and test the project. I have since ported my development work flow over to Android Studio.
	* The concepts of android that I got from this experience include:
		* Android Debugging
		* Basic Android Syntax and libraries
		* Design properties and layouts for front end UI
		* Calling another app and passing information between applications (in this case a key word)
		* How to use intents to start activities in other applications (in this case the bar code scanner)
		* Many other concepts associated with android development

* Where do I get it?
	* Gadget Search can be downloaded from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.derfohappco.gadgetsearch)
