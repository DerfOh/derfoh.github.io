Over the year I have collected a lot of gists of things that I constantly am looking up. If you're not familiar with what a gist is start [here](https://gist.github.com/). Basically it's like pastebin but for code and other snippets that might be useful for saving for later or sharing with other coders.

At any rate though here are a few of the ones that I cobbled together to save myself some googleing.

# [How to add your ssh keys in one line](https://gist.github.com/DerfOh/b65efff31b12c5049077de66fcd86493)

{% highlight bash %}
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh user@hostname "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >>  ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
{% endhighlight %}

# [Cygwin ctrl+arrow key fix](https://gist.github.com/DerfOh/fbf389fc33ee37d7b8675e55b6bcbe96)

Add the following lines to ~/.inputrc (C:\cygwin\home\<username>\.inputrc):
{% highlight bash %}
"\e[1;5C": forward-word   # ctrl + right
"\e[1;5D": backward-word  # ctrl + left 
{% endhighlight %}

# [Set execution mode of a script using git](https://gist.github.com/DerfOh/013482021cc1079e6bb3b2907141bb2e)

Change execution mode of a shell script so that it doesn't get changed after git pull
{% highlight git %}
git update-index --chmod=+x foo.sh

git ls-files --stage
{% endhighlight %}

# [Convert all files in a directory to Unix format](https://gist.github.com/DerfOh/0bf79edfa7569e66e9354c1cc1f5d336)

1. Set up dos2unix

2. Run the following in the directory
{% highlight bash %}
find . -type f -exec dos2unix {} \;
{% endhighlight %}


# [Parse json in one line shell script](https://gist.github.com/DerfOh/3eaba48efcd54834ba0eb667ab23a3cb)

{% highlight bash %}
echo "$foo" | awk -F"[,:]" '{for(i=1;i<=NF;i++){if($i~/bar\042/){print $(i+1)} } }'
{% endhighlight %}
