I got most of the config worked out for this site. Jekyll has been an interesting experience getting set up. I also had to figure out how to set up the default config for a very useful sublime pluggin. Its worth checking out if you use Sublime text as your editor. It is called: [sublime-Jeckyll](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Jekyll).
