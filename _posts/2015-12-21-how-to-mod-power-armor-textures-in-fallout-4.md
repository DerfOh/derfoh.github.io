# Requirements
 * [Paint.net](http://www.getpaint.net/download.html)
 * [Fallout 4](http://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/377160/)
 * [Mods Endabled](http://codingwiththeflow.com/tips/2015/12/17/enabling-fallout-4-mods.html)

Once you have Paint.net and Mods enabled go to the following directory:
`~\steamapps\common\Fallout 4\Data\Textures\Actors\Powerarmor\`
If you do not have the directory make the path.

The textures use the Direct Draw Service or .dds file extension.
The textures you make should be saved with the following naming conventions for each part of the armor, replacing the model type for each part that you're editing.
