# Requirements
 * [Paint.net](http://www.getpaint.net/download.html)
 * [Fallout 4](http://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/377160/)
 * [Mods Endabled](http://codingwiththeflow.com/tips/2015/12/17/enabling-fallout-4-mods.html)

Once you have Paint.net and Mods enabled go to the following directory:
`~\steamapps\common\Fallout 4\Data\Textures\Actors\Powerarmor\`
If you do not have the directory make the path.

The textures use the Direct Draw Service or .dds file extension.

The textures you make should be saved with the following naming conventions for each part of the armor, replacing the model type for each part that you're editing, for this tutorial we will be using the T60 power armor for the brotherhood of steal. You do not necessarily need the `_bos`, `_nightcap`, or `_night` portions of the following, only if you want to edit that particular portion of the armor for the Brotherhood of Steel faction. 

 * Arm metal
 	* t60armmetal_d.dds
 	* Dimensions: 2048 x 2048
 * Body Decal
 	* t60bodydecal_bos_d.dds
 	* Dimensions: 512 x 512
 * Body Metal
	* t60bodymetal_d.dds
	* Dimensions: 2048 x 2048

To start out it might be easiest to learn how to extract the textures that bathesda has
