Hello! This is my first post to my code blog.

Setting up this blog with Jekyll was somewhat difficult overall it took me a few hours to figure out that I was missing half of the files I needed for this to work.

With a little help from a lot of googling though I finally think I have the basics down and at least now I can make posts. YAY!!!

Next up is getting this thing themed.
