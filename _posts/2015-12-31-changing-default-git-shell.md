Had some trouble finding an answer to this, maybe I was wording it wrong. Here it is in case there is another curious party. 

To change the shell that you use do the following:

 1. Click on the cog in the upper right of the GitHub gui
 2. Select `Options`
 3. Directly under `Clone Path` there is an option: `Default Shell`
 4. Select the shell you want to use when you go to start>git shell
 5. Click Save

Now when you select Git Shell from your start menu it will open Git Bash.
