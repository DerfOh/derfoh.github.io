* What is the application?
  * The application is a small script that when run properly on a fresh install of Fallout 4 enables the user to start downloading and installing modified content into their game. I made this script because I was tired of having to do this over and over for myself as well as friends and family. This script provides a simple set of instructions to the user directing them to place it in the appropriate folder and then run it. It then makes the appropriate changes to the ini files of the game to allow modified content to be loaded properly.
  
* What platform is it for?
  * This script is only compatible with Windows operating systems.

* What did you learn from making this?
  * While I understood these things it provided an oportunity for me to reivew how to copy, make, and edit files using a batch script.

* Where do I get it?
  * The script can be obtained from one of two sources:
